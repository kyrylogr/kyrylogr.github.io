## Short bio
I have relevant education, experience and passion in the area of software development.  
I have been developing software professionally for more than 15 years, mainly using C++, Oracle database, CORBA. 
Most of the experience is related to banking software, databases and windows desktop applications development. I also did dozen of successful smaller projects / migrations using C++ and other languages (tcl, html, javascript).  
I try to improve my skills by reading, watching related videos, taking online courses.

+ Python
+ tcl
+ SQL, Oracle pl/sql
+ Delphi

**Some brief knowledge in other languages:**  
octave (matlab), html, css, javascript, google apps script, C#, java

CORBA (Visibroker, TAO, Orbix, Java), SOAP, Jupyter

**Databases:**  
+ Oracle 
  + pl/sql 
  + schema design 
  + query optimization
+ PostgreSQL 
+ Microsoft SQL Server

**Other:**  
git, cmake, conan, windebug (crash dumps), Azure Devops, GNU gettext (internationalization), Jira

## Job history

**Private Enterprise "Mebius" (banking systems) 2000 - 2019**  
I had the following roles: 
* software developer
* project manager in some banking software migrations
* business analyst (gathering requirements and use cases from customers)

**Independent contractor 2015-2019**  
I have completed a number of successful projects including: Windows desktop GUI, calculation models (forecasting, trading simulation), migrations and consulting in the area of CORBA, small google apps script projects.

**Materialise 2019-present**  
I take part in development of medical 3D planning software written in C++/qt. I work on business logic, portions of UI, application performance analysis and improvements, bugfixing. This project is about to have a second release (version 2.0).

## Work achievements and work sample description
* I took part in development of successful core banking system and reporting system/engine. The reporting system is currently used by several Ukrainian banks (including some from top 10)
* reusable UI components (C++ Builder, windows)
* Writing Oracle PL/SQL packages, stored procedures, query optimization
* calculation models for forecasting and trading simulation (C++)
* server business logic (credit risks assessments) (C++)
* Windows desktop applications: GUI (using C++ Builder), process management, (OLE) Automation
* successful large legacy codebase migrations to free CORBA implementations (from Visibroker and ORBIX to TAO, C++)
* integration (consuming) SOAP services from C++
* internationalization of projects written in tcl, C++ Builder
* crash dump analysis (windebug), memory leak detection
* performance profiling
